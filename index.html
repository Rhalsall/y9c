<h1>The super hanger deluxe by Sophie, Ruby and Marc</h1>
<h2>Our goals</h2>
<p> Our main goal throughout this whole process was to be able to help people who find everyday things a struggle and to help make thier lives that much easier. We started off wanting to make a product for the current situation (COVID-19). Our first plan was to help poeple who cant afford to keep buying masks. However, we realized that this particullar product would only be popular DURING the COVID-19 breakout and might not be as successful in a everday situation. Therefore, we decided that it would be best if we went with our next option which is the 'super hanger deluxe'.</p>
<p>The super hanger deluxe is mainly towards people who are disabled and have to stay in a wheelchair due to a disease or accident. We want to be able to help them to be able to do at least one thing that they do everyday a little easier to improve thier lives.</p>
<p> The super hanger deluxes' main goal is to be able to shift it's weight so that people can pull the hanger down to be able to reach it and then as soon as they let go, then the hanger would automatically return to its normal position. We managed to make it to this by adding a weight at the back which can be made by anything, this weight has to be heavier then the hanger, becasue if it wasnt then we wouldnt be able to make it go up on it's own. If it was lighter then it was just fall to the floor. However, if they were both of similar weight then it would be stuking place. Even if the weight was too heavy, then the whole iten would fall behind the railing. Therefore, this product was really hard to make because we have to be able to fond the right weight that wouldnt cause the hanger to do the opposite of what it's meant to do - make life harder.</p>
